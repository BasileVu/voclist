# voclist
A simple app to create vocabulary lists and manage them.

## Context
Do you know the feeling when you're learning something new, you need to write it down somewhere to remember it later ? 
As I'm learning japanese, that's exactly what I'm feeling. I began by simply creating a text file where I put the new words I learned, but
as I added more and more, I wanted to try to group them by categories. The problem is that often, a word can belong to multiple 
categories (will you put "salmon" under the "animal" category or the "food" one ?).

I began to develop this app with the idea that, while providing almost the same functionalities as a text file filled with simply 
words and their translations, the words can belong to multiple categories instead of just one. 
That, and I wanted to try flask and sqlalchemy.
